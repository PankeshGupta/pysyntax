# normal params in function are called as positional parms as
# the values we put at the time of calling a function take their repective
# places inside the orignal functions
# therefor they are called as positional params

# Whereas in case in functional params, the param has some defaault value.
# irrespective of the fact that we provide some value or not
# functioal params are important feature and should be put in practie more often
# it can be thought of more or less like default scope
# one good example is

# def fn(value,interest=10.0,colors_ratio=3):
        # return value*colors_Ration*interest
#
# so this is the example of somewhat like  
# In case we want to change the value of something specifi
# We can provide our required values at the time of calling the funvtion 
# **** but one thing that has to be kept in mind is that we need to give same var name
# 
#  fn(1,b=3,3) # error! named args *after* unamed agrs
